# Survana - Technology Survival Analysis Trends

## Overview
**Survana** is a data-driven platform designed to provide insights into the longevity and trends of various technologies, with a particular focus on programming languages. Using survival analysis techniques, this project estimates how long certain technologies remain relevant, helping developers, researchers, and businesses stay ahead of technological shifts.

This repository contains the source code and data used to perform survival analysis on technology trends, with detailed insights into the lifespan of programming languages and other technologies.

## Key Features
- **Survival Analysis**: Utilize Kaplan-Meier estimators and Cox Proportional Hazards models to study the "survival" of different programming languages and technologies.
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyze the long-term viability of programming languages based on historical data.
- **Data Visualization**: Clear and insightful visualizations of survival functions, confidence intervals, and hazard functions for various technologies.

## Project Scope
- **Technologies Studied**: Programming languages, frameworks, and libraries.
- **Analysis Focus**: Longevity, adoption trends, and obsolescence risk.
